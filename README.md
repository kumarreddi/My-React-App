This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a simple react app with a single button and span to retrieve and display a geek joke.

### Notes

Install the latest node.js and npm from the https://nodejs.org/en/

Run **npm init** after downloading the app to download all the dependent node libraries

**External Dependency**
Called an external api to retrieve data on a button click. We do not have control on that api. The data retrieval is dependent on that api being functional
